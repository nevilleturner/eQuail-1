        <h2>About Equail</h2>
        <p>
            Equail is a new environmental company from Houston, USA. We want to change how electronic waste (<span class="highlight">e-waste</span>) is handled in our area. Our main goal is to collect old and unused electronics by hiring mostly unemployed people. This way, these e-wastes don‚Äôt end up in landfills or hurt the environment. We work with top recycling partners in <span class="highlight">Sweden</span>‚Äîa country known for great recycling methods, to make sure every device we collect is used again in a way that helps the Earth. Equail also helps unemployed people by giving them good job opportunities.
            And Equail can support unemployed people by contributing appropriate job.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Equail, we care about using technology responsibly, helping people understand the environment, and making sure e-waste gets reused instead of thrown away. We follow a clear process to handle e-waste safely, transport it in ways that are good for the Earth, and recycle it with trusted partners at every step.

            <p>
                Equail has set up a network of innovative e-waste collection points, designed like vending machines, across Houston and surrounding areas. Additionally, we hire unemployed individuals to act as e-waste collectors, providing them with certain level of job skills and a steady income. Our collectors are trained to identify and type of e-watste, ensuring that every e-waste is collected and transported transparently.
